    <p>
      Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted, ground coffee beans. Darkly
      colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on
      humans, primarily due to its caffeine content, but decaffeinated coffee is
      also commercially available. There are also various coffee substitutes.
      Typically served hot, coffee has the highest sales in the world market for
      hot drinks.
